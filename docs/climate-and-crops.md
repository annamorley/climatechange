### iSci 3A12 – Climate Change

### Climate Claims: Finding the facts in a “post-truth” world

By: Anna Morley

February 14, 2021

## Top Five Articles 

1: [“Crop Production Keeps Setting New Records as Climate Warms”](https://climaterealism.com/2021/02/crop-production-keeps-setting-new-records-as-climate-warms/)

This article by H. Sterling Burnett from earlier this month (February 2021) claims that global crop yields continue to reach record highs despite the widespread assumption that climate change contributes to crop failure (e.g. from extreme weather conditions, pests with expanding ranges, changing temperatures and drought). The article cites a World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) report (by the USDA) that indicate increased crop production both in the United States and globally.  
 
2: [“New Analysis Shows Population Density Is Corrupting U.S. Temperature Record”](https://climaterealism.com/2021/02/new-analysis-shows-population-density-is-corrupting-u-s-temperature-record/)

This article from early February 2021 builds on previous investigations into the accuracy of weather station measurements in the US. This data is used to test climate models against, and the author believes the temperature trends measured by these stations are artificially higher because of the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect and poor choices in station location and maintenance. This article presents new data by Dr. Spencer suggesting that population density may also have an effect and that the methods used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to account for Urban Heat Islands and other effects are still not producing accurate temperature trends. 

3: [“Why the Current Economic Slowdown Won’t Show Up in the Atmospheric CO2 Record”](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/05/15/why-the-current-economic-slowdown-wont-show-up-in-the-atmospheric-co2-record/)

This article claims that even with the drastic drop in economic activity due to the COVID-19 lockdowns in Spring 2020, there was no noticeable change in atmospheric CO2 compared to the “background of large natural variability” in the atmospheric CO2 budget. As a result, the article argues that widespread efforts to curb our anthropogenic emissions of CO2 will have negligeable climate effects while have extremely costly social and economic effects. I was surprised to hear about the minimal impact the lockdowns had on atmospheric CO2 levels (as claimed by this article), as this seems an unprecedented (although unfortunate) way of testing how significant the human impact truly is. 

4: [“Science Rebuts New Claims that Warming Is Destroying Coral Reefs”](https://climaterealism.com/2020/12/science-rebuts-new-claims-that-warming-is-destroying-coral-reefs/)

This article from December 2020 responds to other mainstream articles attributing the “critical” status of the Great Barrier reef to the “threat” of climate change. The article suggests that other factors such as “inappropriate commercial fishing, terrestrial run-off from farms, and urban development along the coast” have an equal, if not greater, impact on the increasing coral bleaching events. This article also cites the long evolutionary history of coral (including during periods when ocean temperatures were warmer than today) and the coral’s ability to adapt and recover to argue that the climate threat to reefs is overblown by the media. 

5: [“UN Contradicts Its Own Data to Promote Weather Disaster Alarm”](https://climaterealism.com/2020/12/science-rebuts-new-claims-that-warming-is-destroying-coral-reefs/)

This article from October 2020 argues that a United Nations World Meteorological Agency report – which claims that climate change is causing more frequent and severe weather disasters – is actually false. According to this article, the report itself includes data showing a 15% decline in the number of weather-related disasters since the year 2000. The report also cites other statistics and figures suggesting that there has not been an increase in severe weather disasters. Weather-related disasters are often picked up and sensationalized by the media, perhaps portraying a false impression of the severity of today’s disasters compared to those of the pre-industrial past. 


## Analysis of Article #1: The Impact of Climate Change on Crop Production

H. Sterling Burnett’s article uses data from a USDA report published on February 9th, 2021 to show that global crop production is increasing despite climate change. I was intrigued by this article because it used very recent data from a seemingly credible source to overturn the mainstream conception that climate change is negatively affecting crop production and will continue to do so in the future. On the other hand, the article was on a website called Climate Realism that has as its purpose to “debunk the alarmist climate propaganda that dominates the media’s coverage of the environment” (The Heartland Institute, 2021). The website was established and funded by the Heartland Institute, an American right-wing free-market think-tank known to be anti-climate change. This made me wonder whether the information presented in the article was skewed towards downplaying the effects of climate change. 

Fact-checking the article revealed that its primary claim about increases in global crop production is true. Using United Nations data, the World Bank Group reports an increase in food crop production globally from 1961-2016 (The World Bank Group, 2021). The WASDE report (USDA) cited in the article also attests to increased global production of corn, wheat and rice in 2020 (Herath, 2021; Interagency Commodity Estimates Committees, 2021). 

This article seems in direct conflict with the latest IPCC report. The IPCC states that “negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts *(high confidence)*” (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2014). Clearly the data is being presented differently in the IPCC report compared with Burnett’s article. The IPCC (2014) also claims that “climate change is projected to undermine food security.” 

Could it be that global crop production is not an effective metric of the impact of climate change on food security? 
First, there is considerable regional variability in how climate change is impacting agriculture. For instance, there is a greater risk of reduced crop production in regions of South America, Africa and Asia (IPCC, 2015). According to a peer-reviewed paper published by Najafi et al. (2018), the multilevel Bayesian model they developed supports this notion of significant inter-regional variability. They found that countries with irrigation and countries with greater diurnal temperature ranges responded much more positively to increases in CO2. They also found that countries with lower GDP per capita experienced a greater effect of changes in CO2 levels (Najafi et al., 2018). This suggests that developing nations will experience the greatest negative impact of climate change on crop production. Furthermore, it is in these developing nations where more people rely on small-scale commercial or subsistence farming to feed their families and local communities. Changes in productivity in these regions will not register on the scale of global production which is dominated by huge monoculture operations. It is these statistics that Burnett’s article relies on, thereby bypassing potential effects of climate change on the food security in developing countries. The IPCC (2014) states that “climate-related hazards affect poor people’s lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields or the destruction of homes, and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices and food insecurity.” 

This article does not directly present false information, but it also doesn’t portray the whole story around climate change and crop production. Highlighting the increases in crop production is a valid endeavor. Many people probably have the misconception that crops are failing around the world due to climate change, instigated by poor science communication about food security and world hunger. Nevertheless, this data should not be used to deny the impact of climate change on agriculture and food security in more vulnerable parts of the globe. Furthermore, simply because climate change is not having serious negative impacts yet doesn’t mean that they won’t appear in the near future. The consensus in the scientific community is that, without adaptation and following the current trend of rising temperatures, global food security will be seriously at risk as the 21st century advances (IPCC, 2014; Najafi et al., 2018).   

## Reflection 
The most common fallacies I observed were those of the Red Herring and the Straw Man. With the Red Herring fallacy, authors focused on some smaller issue of climate change rather than the bigger picture to argue that things aren’t as bad as the media and climate authorities report. The Straw Man fallacy oversimplifies the argument in order to confidently tear it down. For instance, article #1 uses both of these fallacies to some extent. The author focuses on rising crop production to downplay the consequences of climate change. Furthermore, the article implies that because crop production is increasing, all the information presented by the media about climate change negatively impacting agriculture and food security is exagerated or false. This view omits important information and fails to present the bigger picture. Similarly, the second article focuses on the fact that Urban Heat Islands affect temperature measurements without acknowledging that scientists are already aware of this and have mathematical processes to correct for this.
